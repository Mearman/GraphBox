/**
 * GraphExpander - Interface for dynamic neighbor discovery during graph traversal.
 *
 * Unlike ReadableGraph (which assumes fully-loaded graphs), GraphExpander enables
 * algorithms to work with partially-loaded graphs by dynamically fetching neighbors
 * from external sources (APIs, databases, file systems).
 *
 * Key difference from ReadableGraph:
 * - ReadableGraph: Assumes entire graph is loaded in memory
 * - GraphExpander: Supports lazy-loading and dynamic expansion
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - OpenAlex API calls during traversal
 * - Database queries for large graphs
 * - File-based graph streaming
 * - Caching layers (memory → disk → API)
 *
 * @template T - Type of node data
