/**
 * Algorithm evaluation harness.
 *
 * Provides a structured framework for comparing graph traversal algorithms
 * based on behaviour rather than raw performance.
 *
 * Key principles:
 * - Correctness: Do algorithms find valid paths?
 * - Exploration efficiency: How many nodes/edges are expanded?
 * - Search behaviour: How does traversal order differ?
 * - Diversity: How varied are the discovered paths?
